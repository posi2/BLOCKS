COTTON CULTIVATION IN INDIA 
Cotton is the most important fibre crop not only of India but of the entire world. It provides the basic raw material (cotton fibre) to cotton textile industry. 

CONDITIONS OF GROWTH OF COTTON :

Cotton is the crop of tropical and sub-tropical areas and requires uniformly high temperature varying between 21°C and 30°C. The growth of cotton is retarded when the temperature falls below 20°C. 
The modest requirement of water can be met by an average annual rainfall of 50- 100 cm.
In  India,  there  are  ten  major  cotton  growing  states  which  are  divided  into  three zones,  viz.  north  zone,  central  zone  and  south  zone.  North  zone  consists  of  Punjab, Haryana, and Rajasthan. Central zone includes Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Gujarat. South  zone  comprises  Andhra  Pradesh,  Telangana,  Karnataka  and  Tamil  Nadu.  Besides these  tenStates,  cotton  cultivation  has  gained  momentum  in  the  Eastern  State  of  Orissa. Cotton  is  also  cultivated  in  small  areas  of  non-traditional  States  such  as  Uttar  Pradesh, West Bengal & Tripura.

TYPES OF COTTON :

Three broad types of cotton are generally recognised on the basis of the length, strength and structure of its fibre.

1. Long staple cotton:
It has the longest fibre whose length varies from 24 to 27 mm. It is largely grown in Punjab, Haryana, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh.

2. Medium staple cotton:
The length of its fibre is between 20 mm and 24 mm. About 44 per cent of the total cotton production in India is of medium staple. Rajasthan, Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka and Maharashtra are its main producers. 

3. Short staple cotton:
This is inferior cotton with fibre less than 20 mm long. U.P., Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan, Haryana and Punjab are its main producers.

PRODUCTION 

India has the largest area under cotton cultivation in the world though she is the world’s third largest producer of cotton after China and the USA. Currently it is grown over 6 per cent of the net sown area. Table 24.14 shows the trends in the production of cotton in India. Within India, the central cotton-growing zone produces two-thirds of cotton; including, the states of Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Odisha, where much of the crop is rain fed.The northern zone, which consists of the states of Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan, produces cotton under irrigated conditions and accounts for about 15 percent of production.In the south, the states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu account for 30 percent of production. The Central andSouthern zones typically grow long duration cotton that allows farmers to reap multiple harvests. While the number of pickings has declined as traditional varieties are replaced by biotech hybrids, farmers can still manage up to five pickings per plant depending on weather conditions.In contrast, the irrigated cotton in the northern zone is mostly a short season crop that fits into a cotton-wheat cropping system.
